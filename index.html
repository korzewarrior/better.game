                        <p>This is a PVP boxfighting battle royale.</p>
                        <p>Up to 100 players share a server for 15 minutes. The last player standing wins.</p>
                        <p>There is no ping advantage up to 60 ping, and it feels fine on 250 ping.</p>
                        <p>The client runs at 240 FPS when all players are nearby ramp sliding.</p>
                        <p>The server tick is 120 Hz.</p>
                        <p>The client tick is up to 600 FPS.</p>
                        <p>Replays are full server fidelity, and can be viewed without leaving the game.</p>
                        <p>You always see all 100 players.</p>
                        <p>After you are out, you can spectate the rest of the game like a ghost.</p>
                        <p>You can spectate other games, both live and replayed.</p>
                        <p>Cheating is nearly impossible in pubs, and actually impossible in ranked.</p>
                        <p>Open item shop. Sell anything, customize everything. Players can see and hear different things. Everybody gets a cozy game.</p>
                        <p>The game makes money when people play, and doesn't lose money when they don't. Fixed low operating cost means we will never shutdown. No investors means no shareholder primacy.</p>
                        <p>We doing things better. Pull up, run the 1s.</p>

                        <p>4. Make sure SecureBoot is off in BIOS/boot. If changed, save and exit, then go back to step 3.</p>
                        <p>5. Press F8 to get the boot disk selector.</p>
                        <p>6. Use the arrow keys to select USB, then hit enter.</p>

                        <p>The better game ISO is a modified Arch Linux ISO.</p>
                        <p>The Arch Linux ISO requires you to turn off SecureBoot, so ours does too.</p>
                        <p>About half of motherboards have SecureBoot on by default.</p>
                        <p>Unless you have set up a BIOS password, SecureBoot isn't providing much benefit.</p>
                        <p>The typical end user is not getting much value out of SecureBoot, unless you have a very unusual threat model.</p>
                        <p>We have an open bounty for figuring out how to get SecureBoot to work with our ISO. Someday, someone will figure it out.</p>
                        <p>Disabling SecureBoot is annoying, but necessary. We apologize. This user experience is not better.</p>

                <p class="mb-3">We may withdraw or amend the Services, and any related service or content, or restrict access (including by means of cancellation, termination, modification, or suspension of a user account) to all or certain users (including you) without notice and without liability to you in our reasonable discretion. Additionally, due to your geographic location, the Services or some of their features, services, or content may be unavailable to you. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we may terminate or suspend access to the Services based on your breach of these Terms.</p>

You may only use such Game Currency or Content if you pay the associated fee (if any). When you earn or pay the fee to obtain such Game Currency or Content, you are obtaining or purchasing from Better Game the right to have your License include such Game Currency or Content. Regardless of any references Better Game may make outside this Agreement to purchasing or selling Game Currency or Content, both Game Currency and Content are licensed, not sold, to you under the License.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">Neither Game Currency nor Content are redeemable for money or monetary value from Better Game or any other person, except as otherwise required by applicable law. Game Currency and Content do not have an equivalent value in real currency and do not act as a substitute for real currency. Neither Better Game nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange Game Currency or Content for anything of value, including, but not limited to, real currency. You agree that Better Game may engage in actions that may impact the perceived value or purchase price, if applicable, of Game Currency and Content at any time, except as prohibited by applicable law.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">All purchases of Purchased Game Currency and Content are final and are not refundable, transferable, or exchangeable under any circumstances, except as otherwise required by applicable law. Better Game, in its sole discretion, may impose limits on the amount of Game Currency or Content that may be purchased, earned, accumulated, redeemed, or otherwise used.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Better Game, in its sole discretion, has the absolute right to manage, modify, substitute, replace, suspend, cancel, or eliminate Game Currency or Content, including your ability to access or use Game Currency or Content, without notice or liability to you. You may not transfer, sell, gift, exchange, trade, lease, sublicense, or rent Game Currency or Content except within the Software and as expressly permitted by Better Game.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, Better Game reserves and retains all rights, title, and interest, property or otherwise, in and to the Game Currency and Content. The license to Game Currency and Content under the License will terminate upon termination of the License and as otherwise provided herein.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">When you provide payment information to Better Game or its authorized processor, you represent that you are an authorized user of the payment card, PIN, key, account, or other payment method specified by you, and you authorize Better Game to charge such payment method for the full amount of the transaction.</p>

                <p class="mb-3">Better Game may provide features through the Software or the Services that allow you to create, develop, modify, or contribute Content ("UGC") and to upload, publish, or otherwise make available UGC to some or all users of the Services. These features may also allow you to interact with, manipulate, and change UGC in whole or in part. Better Game may modify, limit, or discontinue certain features of the Service without notice or liability to you.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">"UGC" includes, without limitation, buildings, chat posts, character data, game customization, in-game constructions, replays, cinematics, scripts and programs, modes, gameplay, experiences, interactive features, and screenshots, music, sounds, sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), audiovisual combinations, musical works, animations, voice chat audio data, and other types of works (standalone or in combination).</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>License to Better Game.</strong> If you make or have made available any UGC in the Services, you give Better Game permission to host, copy, import, store, modify, adapt, display, publicly perform (including by means of digital audio transmissions), reproduce (and make mechanical reproductions of musical works embodied in sound recordings), create derivative works of (including synchronize to visual images), publicly display, transfer, sublicense, and distribute (collectively "Use") that UGC, in whole or in part, including for commercial publicity and marketing purposes, in any country. This permission is perpetual and irrevocable and applies to any media, platform, or channel in connection with the Software and Services.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">The rights you grant to Better Game in this Section are provided on a through-to-the-audience basis, which means the owners or operators of third-party services will not have any separate liability to you or any other third party for UGC provided to or used on such third-party services via the Service. Better Game needs these permissions in order to make your UGC available to players as part of the Services (i.e., in-game), and to make it available to streamers and content creators off of the Services (e.g., for use on other platforms). These rights need to be irrevocable because of the many channels in which UGC is distributed by us and others after it's created.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">You understand that you are not entitled to receive any compensation, fees, consideration, or other remuneration in connection with your UGC for any reason, including Better Game's exercise of the rights you grant to Better Game in this Section, and that Better Game is not obligated to exercise the rights you grant.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>Musical Works.</strong> Better Game may, in its sole discretion, choose to make available sound recordings and the musical works embodied in the sound recordings ("Licensed Music") in connection with UGC. If Better Game makes available Licensed Music for use in your UGC, Better Game grants you a non-exclusive, personal, limited, revocable, non-transferable license to:</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">(a) Synchronize the Licensed Music into UGC during the period of time that the Licensed Music is made available through the Services;</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">(b) Play, listen, and interact with UGC containing Licensed Music solely through the Services.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">Your modifications (e.g., edits, use of a portion of) the Licensed Music to synchronize into the UGC are considered derivative works included in the definition of Licensed Music, the rights to which are retained by Better Game and its licensors.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3"><strong>Special Rules for Recording Artists.</strong> If you are a composer or author of a musical work and are:</p>

                <p class="mb-3">then you must notify the interested party of the royalty-free license you grant through this Agreement to Better Game. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance with the relevant party's reporting or contractual obligations, and (if applicable) obtaining the consent of that party to grant the royalty-free license(s) in this Agreement, including if you create any new recordings through the Service that your label may attempt to claim.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">You represent and warrant that any UGC containing Licensed Music is not subject to and Better Game has no obligation to pay royalties to any third party, including without limitation a sound recording copyright owner (e.g., a record label), a musical work copyright owner (e.g., a music publisher), a PRO (e.g., ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.), a sound recording PRO, any unions or guilds, or other third parties.</p>

                <p class="mb-3">(c) Better Game does not need to obtain any further licenses, provide attribution, or pay royalties or other compensation to any third parties; and</p>

You further knowingly and irrevocably agree to not exercise any Moral Rights in and to your UGC that you have not waived in any manner that interferes with any exercise of granted rights.

                <p class="mb-3">Nothing in this Agreement will prejudice the statutory rights that you may have as a consumer of the Software or Services. Some countries, states, provinces, or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability as stated in this section, so the below terms may not fully apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the exclusions and limitations below shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">The Software (including any Game Currency and Content) and Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, "with all faults" and without warranty of any kind.

                <p class="mb-3">Except to the extent required by law, all payments and fees are non-refundable under all circumstances, regardless of whether or not this Agreement has been terminated.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">Sections 2, 5–9, and 11–15 will survive any termination of this Agreement.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mb-2">11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">This Agreement is entered into in the State of Hawaii, U.S.A., and shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Hawaii, exclusive of its choice of law rules. For any disputes between you and Better Game arising out of or relating to this Agreement, you and Better Game agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located in Kona or Waimea, Hawaii.

The Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this Agreement.

            <div class="p-3">
                <p class="mb-3">Welcome to Better Game!</p>

                <p class="mb-3">Better Game is headquartered in Waikoloa, Hawaii. We and our subsidiaries have offices and operations located around the world that help create and deliver Better Game.</p>

                <p class="mb-3">This privacy policy describes the different ways we may collect, use, and share information on, through, or in connection with the Better Game Services (see "What are the Better Game Services?" below). If you have any questions, you can always reach out to us as described in "Contact Us" below.</p>

                <p class="mb-3">When we refer to "Better Game" (or any similar terms like "we" or "us") in this privacy policy, we mean the Better Game entity that controls and is responsible for your information, including Better Game and its subsidiaries that help provide and support the Better Game Services.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mb-2">1. WHAT ARE THE BETTER GAME SERVICES?</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">We use the term "Better Game Services" to describe any Better Game products or services that directly link to this privacy policy. These include, for example:</p>
                
                <ul class="mb-3">
                    <li>Better Game.</li>
                    <li>Developer tools, including the Developer Portal and related software.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-3">Note that your use of the Better Game Services may also be subject to additional terms and conditions. For example, you must review and accept the Better Game End User License Agreement to play our games.</p>

                <p class="mb-3">Please read this entire privacy policy. You should also carefully review any other agreements that apply to the Better Game Services you use, and confirm you understand and agree to them, before using those products or services.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mb-2">2. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">The types of information we collect depend on how you interact with us. Generally speaking, we collect information in three main ways: A) when you provide it to us, B) automatically when you use the Better Game Services, and C) from service providers and third parties.</p>
                
                <h4 class="mb-2">A. Information You Provide</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">You can provide us with different kinds of information depending on how you interact with the Better Game Services. Sometimes we'll ask you to provide specific pieces of information, such as when we require it to provide parts of the Better Game Services to you (for example, by prompting you to provide your date of birth or complete an online registration process). If we ask you to provide us with information in these cases and you choose not to, you may not be able to access the relevant Better Game Services and/or some features may not operate as intended.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">For instance, in order to make purchases on our platform and to play some of our games, you'll need a Better Game account. To create one, you'll need to provide us with basic registration information like your name, a public-facing display name, password, the country you live in, and email address. If you want to make a purchase, we may ask you to provide payment-related information (like your credit card number and expiration date) to complete the transaction. In addition, many of our services require your date of birth to determine which features we can offer you and which settings to apply to your account based on your age and location.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">We also collect the information you voluntarily provide to sign up for email alerts, use social features like forums or chat, register for early access to our games, use our developer tools (including to create and publish games and other content), enable two-factor authentication, register for or attend our events, complete surveys, or contact us through Player Support requests or customer service. If you use our voice chat feature and voice reporting is enabled in a voice channel, snippets of voice chat audio data will be stored on your device and the devices of participants in the voice channel. If a violation of our Community Rules is reported, these snippets may be transmitted to Better Game to help us enforce those Community Rules. If you enter a contest or competitive event, or participate in our creator programs, we'll collect your application information and other information we may need to help confirm your eligibility and process payouts. We collect whatever information you choose to provide to us in those or other similar cases.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="p-3">
                <h4 class="mb-2">B. Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">We collect some information automatically when you visit, access, or use the Better Game Services. This includes information about your gameplay or application usage, purchases, entitlements, and other activity in the Better Game Services, typically associated with your account (if you are logged into your Better Game account or use a third-party account to access the Better Game Services) or with an identifier we have assigned to your device or profile. While the specific types of information that we automatically collect may vary, they generally include:</p>
                
                <ul class="mb-3">
                    <li>Usage information and statistics about how you interact with the Better Game Services, including the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, gameplay attempts, progression and results, saved preferences, crash reports, the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, and platform type;</li>
                    <li>Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access our services, such as IP address, device identifiers, your internet service provider, plugins, or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system-related specifications); and</li>
                    <li>General location of your device, which we typically derive from your device's IP address.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-3">The Better Game Services use technologies such as cookies, log files, and web beacons to automatically collect the types of information listed above. Some of these technologies may create small files or record-keeping tools that may be stored on your device. They help us, our service providers, and third parties recognize your device and provide information about how you use and interact with the Better Game Services. For example, they support our ability to authenticate users, remember preferences, manage advertising, personalize experiences, and conduct data analytics.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">Please note that if certain features on the Better Game Services are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of the Better Game Services, their services, or others' websites over time. For example, when you use Better Game Services that include third-party software, those third-party providers may collect information through their technology. These features are subject to those third parties' privacy notices and policies.</p>
                
                <h4 class="mb-2">C. Information We Collect from Other Sources</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">In some cases, we may also receive information about you from service providers and third parties in connection with your use of the Better Game Services or your interactions with us on other platforms.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">For example, some other developers allow you to use your Better Game account to log in to their service. And if you choose to link your Better Game account with your account on a third-party social media (like Facebook), gaming (like Steam), or other similar website or service, or if you interact with an ad for one of the Better Game Services on an external website or service, the company that operates that website or service may share some information with Better Game in accordance with their own privacy practices. Your privacy settings on the other company's website or service typically control the specific types of information they can share with Better Game, so please be sure to review and update them regularly. Common examples for linked accounts might include your third-party account display name and user ID, as well as associated device information, name, and email address.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">You can also buy, download, or access some Better Game Services on or through services operated by third parties. If you do, they may provide us with information to facilitate your access to and use of the Better Game Services. This typically includes information like your display name, user ID, and device and region information. For example, you can choose to download and play our games on gaming consoles (like PlayStation®, Microsoft Xbox, and Nintendo Switch) through your gaming console account. When you do, the company operating that platform or service may share some information with us, which helps us do things like facilitate your gameplay and track your progression and entitlements.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="p-3">
                <h4 class="mb-2">D. Fraud Prevention & Anti-Cheat</h4>
                <p class="mb-3">Providing users with a fair, balanced, and competitive experience on the Better Game Services is extremely important to us. We strictly enforce prohibitions against cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the Better Game Services. We use a variety of anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies to help us identify and prevent malicious activity. These services may collect and analyze data about your computer and the software on your computer to detect cheating and may be provided by Better Game or by service providers.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mb-2">3. HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION?</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">As a general matter, we use the information we collect (either individually or in combination with other information collected as described in this policy) to help us provide, improve, customize, analyze, and promote the Better Game Services.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-3">This includes using it for purposes such as:</p>
                
                <ul class="mb-3">
                    <li>Creating, verifying, and managing user accounts and features;</li>
                    <li>Providing the Better Game Services, as well as support and assistance for them, including by responding to inquiries, processing transactions or requests, and communicating with users (such as by sending service and account-related messages and updates);</li>
                    <li>Developing, delivering, and improving the Better Game Services and other offerings, some of which may be offered in partnership with other parties;</li>
                    <li>Personalizing your experience, including by presenting content or features better tailored to you or your interests, or our inferences about your interests (for instance, if you frequently play games in a certain genre, we may infer that you'd be interested in that genre and suggest similar games to you);</li>
                    <li>Promoting the Better Game Services, including managing, customizing, and measuring the effectiveness of our advertisements, promotional offers, surveys, and events;</li>
                    <li>Managing alpha, beta, or early access tests (and collecting feedback);</li>
                    <li>Conducting data analytics (like analyzing how the Better Game Services are used so we can better understand, improve, and personalize them);</li>
                    <li>Complying with our legal or contractual obligations and enforcing our terms; and</li>
                    <li>Securing the Better Game Services, such as by detecting fraud and otherwise protecting Better Game and other users from illegal or harmful actions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-3">We may also process information that does not identify you individually, including aggregate or de-identified information that we create or collect from other sources. This information helps us better understand larger groups of users. If we combine this information with information that identifies you, we will treat it as described in this privacy policy. But please note that this privacy policy does not restrict our ability to process information that does not individually identify you, and we may use and disclose aggregated or de-identified information for any reason permitted by law.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mb-2">4. HOW DO WE SHARE INFORMATION?</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">We may share some of the information we collect to help operate and improve the Better Game Services. Depending on how you interact with us, common examples might include sharing:</p>
                
                <ul class="mb-3">
                    <li>With console and platform partners (for example, to facilitate gameplay when you access the Better Game Services through a third-party console provider);</li>
                    <li>With other game developers (such as to enable features for games you acquire through the Better Game platform);</li>

                    <li>Publicly (for example, your display name, content you create or share, basic game statistics, and other similar information may be generally accessible to others);</li>
                    <li>With service providers that operate on our behalf to help support the Better Game Services in accordance with our instructions (for example, cloud storage providers, payment processors, or marketing and advertising partners);</li>
                    <li>When we believe we must in order to comply with the law or to protect you, Better Game, or others (for example, in response to a court order or subpoena, as part of an investigation of fraud or other illegal activity, or violation of our terms or policies, or if necessary to protect others from death or serious harm to body or property);</li>
                    <li>With other Better Game entities (including to help provide support for the Better Game Services internationally);</li>
                    <li>In connection with certain types of corporate transactions (like in the event of a restructuring or the sale of all or a significant part of our business); and</li>
                    <li>With your permission (for example, if you link external accounts with your Better Game account, or use your Better Game account to sign in to third-party games and services or participate in cross-promotional events).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p class="mb-3">We may also share information that does not identify you with third parties, including aggregate or de-identified information.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-2">5. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</h3>
                <p class="mb-3">If you are under the legal age of majority in your country of residence, you may use the Better Game Services only with the consent and under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the age of digital consent in your region, whichever is higher) without parental consent. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

                <h3 class="mb-2">6. YOUR CHOICES AND CONTROLS</h3>
